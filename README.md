# ðŸŽ¬ BS Quick Video Editor
A lightweight video editor tailored for Beat Saber gameplay editing. Trim videos, apply transitions, boost saturation, and overlay BeatSaver metadata.

## What is this?

This tool helps you quickly edit raw video clips of Beat Saber gameplay or map previews. It:

- Trims a video between two timestamps
- Applies fade-in and fade-out effects
- Boosts video saturation for good looking videos despite YouTube's evil compression
- Generates a map overlay with:
  - Song title
  - Mapper name
  - Cover image
-  Shows the overlay with a smooth slide animation
